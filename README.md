This file contains three implementations of machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Support Vector Machines) and are tested in their efficiency in predicting heart disease in patients given a particular dataset. The dataset was collected researchers at UC Irvine and can be found in the following link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
